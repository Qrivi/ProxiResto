ProxiResto is a small PHP website I work(ed) on in between college classes, that offers a simple and mobile first UI to consult campus Proximus' student restaurant's weekly menu.

The website is available in Dutch and English, and you can choose whether you want to see student prices or visitor prices â€” features missing in UCLL's own implementation even though many people visiting the restaurant are exchange students or visitors.

Far from being the best PHP website I ever made, but a quick and rather solid solution to a real life problem!
